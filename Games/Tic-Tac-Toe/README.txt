	Stage 1/5: Welcome to the battlefield! (medium)
Description
Tic-tac-toe is a game played by two players on a 3x3 field.
One of the players plays as 'X', and the other player is 'O'. 'X' plays first, then the 'O' side plays, and so on. 
The players write 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 field.
The first player that writes 3 'X' or 3 'O' in a straight line (including diagonals) wins.
Your first task in this project is to print any state of the field in the console output.
Example
The example below shows how your output might look.
X O X
O X O
X X O


	Stage 2/5: The user is the gamemaster (hard)
Description
In this stage, you should write a program that reads 9 symbols from the input and
writes an appropriate 3x3 field. Elements of the field can contain only 'X', 'O' and '_'
symbols.
Note, that field has a specific format and should start and end with ---------, all
lines in between should start and end with '|' symbol and everything in the middle
should be separated with a single space.
Examples below show how your output should look.
Example 1:
Enter cells: O_OXXO_XX
---------
| O _  O |
| X X O |
| _  X X |
---------

Example 2:
Enter cells: OXO__X_OX
---------
| O X O |
| _ _   X |
| _  O X |
---------

Example 3:
Enter cells: _XO__X___
---------
| _ X O |
| _ _  X |
| _ _  _ |
---------


	Stage 3/5: What's up on the field? (hard)
Description
In this stage, you should analyze a Tic-Tac-Toe field.
Note. In this stage either 'X' or 'O' can start the game.
After printing the field, you need to find the state in which the game is at the
moment. Possible states:
● "Game not finished" - when no side has a three in a row but the field has
empty cells;
● "Draw" - when no side has a three in a row and the field has no empty cells;
● "X wins" - when the field has three X in a row;
● "O wins" - when the field has three O in a row;
● "Impossible" - when the field has three X in a row as well as three O in a row. Or
the field has a lot more X's than O's or vice versa (if the difference is 2 or more,
should be 1 or 0).
Also, you can use ' ' or '_' to print empty cells - it's up to you.
Examples: The examples below show outputs for some predefined states. Your
program should work in the same way.

Example 1:
Enter cells: XXXOO__O_
---------
| X X X |
| O O _ |
| _ O _ |
---------
X wins

Example 2:
Enter cells: XOXOXOXXO
---------
| X O X |
| O X O |
| X X O |
---------
X wins

Example 3:
Enter cells: XOOOXOXXO
---------
| X O O |
| O X O |
| X X O |
---------
O wins

Example 4:
Enter cells: XOXOOXXXO
---------
| X O X |
| O O X |
| X X O |
---------
Draw

Example 5:
Enter cells: XO_OOX_X_
---------
| X O _ |
| O O X |
| _ X _ |
---------
Game not finished

Example 6:
Enter cells: XO_XO_XOX
---------
| X O _ |
| X O _ |
| X O X |
---------
Impossible

Example 7:
Enter cells: _O_X__X_X
---------
| _ O _ |
| X _ _ |
| X _ X |
---------
Impossible

Example 8:
Enter cells: _OOOO_X_X
---------
| _ O O |
| O O _ |
| X _ X |
---------
Impossible

	Stage 4/5: First move! (hard)
Description
Now you need to implement human moves.
Suppose the bottom left cell has the coordinates (1, 1) and the top right cell has the
coordinates (3, 3) like in this table:
(1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)
(1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)
(1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)
The program should work in the following way:
Get the 3x3 field from the input as in the previous stages,
Output this 3x3 field with cells before the user's move,
Then ask the user about his next move,
Then the user should input 2 numbers that represent the cell on which user wants to
make his X or O. (9 symbols representing the field would be on the first line and these 2
numbers would be on the second line of the user input),
Then output the table including the user's most recent move.
Do not delete code that checks for table state; it will be useful in the future.
Note that in this stage the user moves as X, not O. Keep in mind that the first
coordinate goes from left to right and the second coordinate goes from bottom to top.
Also, notice that coordinates start with 1 and can be 1, 2 or 3.
But what if the user enters incorrect coordinates? The user could enter symbols
instead of numbers or enter coordinates representing occupied cells. You need to
prevent all of that by checking a user's input and catching possible exceptions.
The program should also check user input. If the user input is unsuitable, the
program should ask him to enter coordinates again.
So, you need to output a field from the first line of the input and then ask the user to
enter a move. Keep asking until the user enters a coordinate that represents an empty
cell on the field and after that output the field with that move. You should output the
field only 2 times - before the move and after a legal move.
Examples: The examples below show how your program should work.

Example 1:
Enter cells: X_X_O____
---------
| X X |
| O |
| |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 1 1
---------
| X X |
| O |

Enter cells: _XXOO_OX_
---------
| X X |
| O O |
| O X |
---------

Enter the coordinates: 1 3

	Stage 5/5: Fight! (hard)
Description
Now it is time to make a working game! In the last stage, make it so you can play a
full game with a friend. First one of you moves as X, and then the other one moves as O.
You need to create a game loop. The game starts with empty cells and ends when
someone wins or there is a draw. You need to output the final result after the end of the
game. The example below shows how your program should work.
---------
|           |
|           |
|           |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 2
---------
|           |
| X       |
|           |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 2
This cell is occupied! Choose another one!
Enter the coordinates: two two
You should enter numbers!
Enter the coordinates: 1 4
Coordinates should be from 1 to 3!
Enter the coordinates: 1 3
---------
| O        |
| X        |
|            |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 3 1
---------
| O       |
| X       |
| X       |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 1 2
---------
| O       |
| O X   |
| X       |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 1 1
---------
| O       |
| O X   |
| X X   |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 3 2
---------
| O        |
| O X O |
| X X     |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 1
---------
| O         |
| O X O |
