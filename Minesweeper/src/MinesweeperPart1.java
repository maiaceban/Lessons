Description
Minesweeper is a game with a field in which there are a lot of mines. You need to find where all these mines are located.
To help you find the mines, there are cells that show how many mines are located around them.
Your first step would be easy. In this step, you need to output some state of the field.
The field contains mines marked as 'X' and safe places marked as '.', but you can choose your own symbols for marking
places with mines and safe places. Note that all the mines are in plain sight, so you don't have to hide them from
the user at this stage!
Example
In the example, there are 10 mines in a 9x9 field. You can write to the output of any
other configuration of mines.
